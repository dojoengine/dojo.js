# Bun Test Migration for @packages/grpc

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated from Vitest to Bun Test for regular unit tests in the @packages/grpc package, while maintaining Vitest for benchmark tests using a hybrid approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Files
- **Updated**: `src/client.test.ts`
  - Changed import from `vitest` to `bun:test`
  - Replaced `it` with `test` (both are supported, but `test` is more conventional in Bun)
  - All other test syntax remains the same (describe, expect, etc.)

### 2. Package Configuration
- **Updated**: `package.json`
  - Changed test script: `"test": "bun test"`
  - Kept benchmark script: `"bench": "vitest bench --config vitest.config.bench.ts"`
  - Maintained Vitest as a devDependency for benchmarks only

### 3. Hybrid Approach Benefits
- **Consistency**: Aligns with other packages like @packages/state that use Bun Test
- **Performance**: Bun Test runs faster than Vitest for unit tests
- **Benchmarks**: Maintains existing benchmark infrastructure with Vitest
- **Minimal Disruption**: No changes needed to benchmark files or reporting

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run specific test file
bun test src/client.test.ts

# Run tests with watch mode
bun test --watch
```

### Benchmarks
```bash
# Run all benchmarks
bun run bench

# Run specific benchmark
bunx vitest bench --config vitest.config.bench.ts src/benchmarks/entities.bench.ts

# Run benchmarks with report generation
bun run bench:full
```

## Test Results

✅ **Unit Tests**: Successfully running with Bun Test
- 1 test file migrated
- All tests passing
- Execution time: ~26ms

✅ **Benchmarks**: Still functioning with Vitest
- All benchmark files unchanged
- Performance metrics collection working
- Report generation intact

## Future Considerations

1. **Benchmark Migration**: Consider migrating benchmarks to a Bun-compatible solution in the future:
   - Option: Use `mitata` or `tinybench` libraries with Bun
   - Option: Create custom benchmarking utilities

2. **Coverage Reporting**: If code coverage is needed:
   - Bun has built-in coverage support with `bun test --coverage`
   - Can generate coverage reports in various formats

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure CI pipelines are updated to use `bun test` for this package

## Dependencies Status

- ✅ Vitest: Kept as devDependency (for benchmarks)
- ✅ @vitest/coverage-v8: Can be removed if not using coverage
- ✅ vitest.config.bench.ts: Kept for benchmark configuration

## Conclusion

The migration to Bun Test is complete and successful. The hybrid approach allows for a smooth transition while maintaining all existing functionality. This setup provides the benefits of Bun's faster test execution for unit tests while preserving the robust benchmarking capabilities of Vitest.
